        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Raga Swaroopa — a curious learner and aspiring developer. I'm currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Data Science and Programming from IIT Madras and a B.A. (Hons) in Spanish from EFLU, which is kind of an unusual mix, but it reflects my love for both logic and language.

I got into programming out of curiosity, and over time, I’ve worked on small but meaningful projects — from building a quiz management app to experimenting with AI assistants for teachers and farmers. Most of these started as college assignments or personal ideas that I wanted to bring to life. I'm not trying to build the next unicorn startup (at least not yet), just trying to learn by doing.

Outside of tech, I'm pretty active. I've played badminton since I was a kid, and one of my favorite memories is winning a tournament organized by the AP government in Delhi back in 2017, where I got the chance to meet PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth — a huge moment for me as a fan.

I’m also a classically trained Kuchipudi dancer and have been practicing for nearly 10 years. These days, I’m exploring Western dance styles too, just to step out of my comfort zone and have fun with movement in different forms.

Right now, I’m interested in how AI can solve real-world problems, especially in securities sector. I’m still figuring out what kind of developer (and person) I want to become, but for now, I’m enjoying the process of exploring, building, and learning — both online and offline.
